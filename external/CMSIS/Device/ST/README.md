## CMSIS device headers for STM32

This folder includes the CMSIS device headers for all STM32 devices. The files
located here are part of the `STM32Cube` libraries and can be found inside the
`STM32Cube*/Drivers/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32F*xx/Include` folder.

The files are copied and modified by converting all line endings from Windows to
Unix style and removing all trailing whitespace.

Here is the list of the current device header version and release date as well
as the Cube release version in braces:
